# Carousel

The Carousel component is used to display a series of images or other content in a rotating fashion. This component is used on the homepage of the site. It depends on a custom webpage created in Expression Engine because there is no API provided by SUMS.

```html
{if segment_3 != ""}
    {exp:su_banners:banners short_name="{segment_3}"} 
        [
            {banners} 
                {"url": "{url}", "img": "{file_url}", "alt": "{alt}"}, 
            {/banners} 
        ]
    {/exp:su_banners:banners} 
{/if}
```

This file is placed under a template group called API, then a template called banners and returns the banners based on the short name in `segment_3` of the URL. Eg. `/api/banners/whats-on` would be used for the what's on carousel.
