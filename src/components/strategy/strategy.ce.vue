            OUR STRATEGY
          </h2>
          <p>
            We are the University of York Students’ Union. We exist to make sure
            every student at York gets the most out of their time here. From
            hosting events, to running elections, overseeing clubs and
            societies, and providing a helping hand when it’s needed. The work
            we do is led by seven elected sabbatical officers, who represent
            students to the University, the city of York, and nationally.

            Each year, our new set of Sabbatical Officers create a group
            manifesto to guide their work for the upcoming year. Using the York
            SU strategy as a foundation, they build upwards to create tangible
            and measurable actions, which are more immediately related to the
            student journey here in York(such as house prices) creating a local
            action plan for the year.

                    annual reports on sustainability strategies). We have also

                    groups. This includes the Overseas Together campaign,
                    lobbying for changes to the Winter Graduation timeline,
                    IPAL, the BAME Creative Showcase and the introduction of the
                    South Asian football league. There is still a pressing need
                    to find ways to include underrepresented student groups
                    across all of our Union activities, and this continues to be
                    a key Office priority.

        <p>
          A great way of measuring both the impact of the Union and our students
          - and also a great practice in acknowledging the positive things that
          come from collaborating - is the annual Impact Report - a celebration
          of all the good things from that academic year. But it’s also a chance
          to reflect on what could have been done differently and look forward
          to the year ahead!
