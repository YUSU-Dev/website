# Student Dashboard Redirect

This page is used to redirect students to the student dashboard and is not a web component on the site.

This html is used at the bottom of the page. Any changes made to this file will need to be manually updated in the `student-dashboard` page.

```html
{if logged_in}
<body onload="dashRedirect()">
  <script src="/student-dashboard/dash-redirect.js"></script>
  {if:else}
  <body onload="sso()">
    <script src="/student-dashboard/sso.js"></script>
    {/if}
  </body>
</body>
```

<Canvas of={StudentDashboardStories.Default} />
