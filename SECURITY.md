### Guidelines for reporting a vulnerability

When you are investigating and reporting the vulnerability in one of York SU's open source repositories, or a website on the York SU domain or subdomain, you must not:

- break the law
- access unnecessary or excessive amounts of data
- modify data
- use high-intensity invasive or destructive scanning tools to find vulnerabilities
- try a denial of service - for example overwhelming a service on yorksu.org with a high volume of requests to disrupt yorksu.org services or systems
- tell other people about the vulnerability you have found until we have disclosed it
- social engineer, phish or physically attack our staff or infrastructure
- demand money to disclose a vulnerability
